# Combining-congestion-and-emission-data
Framework written in Python to collect and match open-source air quality and traffic congestion data. 

-   The setup consits of two parts; the main part can be find under 'Data_collector.py' and the second part is called 'Data_matcher.py'. 
-   The framework collects open-source air-quality data from the World Air Quality Index (WAQI) and traffic congestion data from TOMTOM. 
-   It is created in such a way that the ONLY inputs into the framework are the geographical coordinates of the arae you want the data collected of. 
-   Therefore is is necessary the check beforehand if the data is available within you geographical boundaries.
